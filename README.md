## FAQ

>  Why did you change the old website?

Our team enjoyed our old site, however, we knew that it was time for change. Not only did we want to create a site that was more modern and easier to maintain, we also wanted to create a site that was more accessible to our members and the public. We hope that you enjoy our new site!
<br/>

>  Why did you choose Astro.js?

With Astro.js, it brings the best parts of static site generation and combines it reactivity and the astro.js islands architecture.

This allows us to utilize tools such as TypeScript, React, and Framer-motion to craft wonderful animations, have drop-in content generation, and an intuitive overall user interface.
