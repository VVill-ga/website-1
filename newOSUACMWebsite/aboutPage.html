                <h1>What is OSU ACM?</h1>
                <p>The Oregon State University ACM Student Chapter is an officially recognized ACM chapter where OSU students and faculty can meet and share an interest in all things Computer Science. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and professional networking. The OSU ACM Chapter is mainly focused on competitive programming, technical interview strategy, and industry knowledge. Our flagship event is competing at the International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC), one of the world's largest, oldest, and most prestigious programming competitions.</p>

                <h1>What is competitive programming?</h1>
                <p>Competitive programming involves writing code to solve a set of problems the fastest and most efficiently. Generally, the problems focus on mathematics, graph theory, data structures, and computer science algorithm topics. As the name suggests, participants or teams of participants are competing against each other to complete solutions the fastest.</p>
