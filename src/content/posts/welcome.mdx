# Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using a plain text format while still incorporating various formatting elements. In this blog post, we'll explore different typography and features that Markdown (specifically MDX) has to offer.

## Headings

Markdown supports six levels of headings, ranging from `#` for the main title to `######` for the smallest subheading.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Emphasis

You can add emphasis to your text using asterisks `*` or underscores `_`.

_This text is italicized._
_This text is also italicized._

**This text is bold.**
**This text is also bold.**

## Lists

Markdown supports both ordered and unordered lists.

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2.1
  - Subitem 2.2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 2.1
   2. Subitem 2.2
3. Third item

## Links

Creating links in Markdown is simple. You can use `[text](url)` syntax.

## Blockquotes

You can create blockquotes using the `>` symbol.

## Code

Inline code can be highlighted using backticks `code`, while code blocks use triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}
```
